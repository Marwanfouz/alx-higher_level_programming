# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
-----------
## Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
    All your files should end with a new line
    The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
    Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
    All your files must be executable
    The length of your files will be tested using wc
    All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
    All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
    All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
    A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## 0. My first square
mandatory

Write an empty class Square that defines a square:

    You are not allowed to import any module
------------
## 1. Square with size
mandatory

Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py)

    Private instance attribute: size
    Instantiation with size (no type/value verification)
    You are not allowed to import any module

Why?

Why size is private attribute?

The size of a square is crucial for a square, many things depend of it (area computation, etc.), so you, as class builder, must control the type and value of this attribute. One way to have the control is to keep it privately. You will see in next tasks how to get, update and validate the size value.
------------
## 2. Size validation
mandatory

Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)

    Private instance attribute: size
    Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
        size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
        if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
    You are not allowed to import any module

------------
## 3. Area of a square
mandatory

Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)

    Private instance attribute: size
    Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
        size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
        if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
    Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
    You are not allowed to import any module

------------
## 4. Access and update private attribute
mandatory

Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)

    Private instance attribute: size:
        property def size(self): to retrieve it
        property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
            size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
            if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
    Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
    Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
    You are not allowed to import any module

------------
## 5. Printing a square
mandatory

Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)

    Private instance attribute: size:
        property def size(self): to retrieve it
        property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
            size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
            if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
    Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
    Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
    Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
        if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
    You are not allowed to import any module

------------
## 6. Coordinates of a square
mandatory

Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)

    Private instance attribute: size:
        property def size(self): to retrieve it
        property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
            size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
            if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
    Private instance attribute: position:
        property def position(self): to retrieve it
        property setter def position(self, value): to set it:
            position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers
    Instantiation with optional size and optional position: def __init__(self, size=0, position=(0, 0)):
    Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
    Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
        if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
        position should be use by using space - Don’t fill lines by spaces when position[1] > 0
    You are not allowed to import any module

------------
## 7. Singly linked list
#advanced

Write a class Node that defines a node of a singly linked list by:

    Private instance attribute: data:
        property def data(self): to retrieve it
        property setter def data(self, value): to set it:
            data must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message data must be an integer
    Private instance attribute: next_node:
        property def next_node(self): to retrieve it
        property setter def next_node(self, value): to set it:
            next_node can be None or must be a Node, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message next_node must be a Node object
    Instantiation with data and next_node: def __init__(self, data, next_node=None):

And, write a class SinglyLinkedList that defines a singly linked list by:

    Private instance attribute: head (no setter or getter)
    Simple instantiation: def __init__(self):
    Should be printable:
        print the entire list in stdout
        one node number by line
    Public instance method: def sorted_insert(self, value): that inserts a new Node into the correct sorted position in the list (increasing order)
    You are not allowed to import any module

        property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
            size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
            if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
    Private instance attribute: position:
        property def position(self): to retrieve it
        property setter def position(self, value): to set it:
            position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message position must be a tuple of 2 positive integer

        if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
        position should be use by using space
    Printing a Square instance should have the same behavior as my_print()
